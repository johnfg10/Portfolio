# Introduction
This is my portfolio which contains most of my projects especially ones im especially proud, so i may leave out older or
less helpful projects i will also include my additions to other library's.

## Why software development?
I started software development a long time ago now my first public github project was late 2016 but i started learning 
mid 2016, I began wanting simply to make a mod for a game called Minecraft which sort of spiraled and now i am looking
to do software development as a career.


## CSharp
### Introduction
Most of my work in C# has either been for college where we had to make a game that teaches children diffrent colors or 
utilities for the Windows operating system namely download_cleaner which allowed customizable tasks to be made to clean 
your computer

### Child's color game
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/ChildsColorGame]

This was a project i had to create for my Level 3 extended diploma in IT, it was designed to help young children
learning new colors and to memorize them this was assisted by using characters from T.V children's programs which 
would easily grab the child's interest. This used WPF for the UI elements.

### Download cleaner
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/download_cleaner]

This was a project i created as i was boring with having to repeatably clear my downloads folder since i would normally
use it simply as temporary storage for install files etc i wondered why i couldn't just make it auto delete on restart 
for example so i decided that i would make a app that did exactly that this app later after requests from friends 
extended into a XML based system that would read "tasks" and execute where required, this could be run on startup or as 
a flag on the command line.

### GameDesignProject
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/GameDesignProject]

This was a project we had to do for my Level 3 extended diploma it wasn't my best work simply because i had several 
issues with Unity. although i did complete it and got a Distinction grade overall.

## Java
### Introduction
Java is one of my favourite languages for two reasons firstly the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is amazing, its fast it 
reduces memory leaks and its far more resistant that some other approaches. Secondly the library's available for the JVM
are simply amazing and is supported by some amazing non-profit organizations such as Eclipse and Apache as well as big 
companies like Google, Twitter and Netflix which produce some amazing library's that make development a breeze. Also the
learning resources on sites like Stack Overflow are very helpful when trying to solve a problem as 99% of the time someone
has already solved your exact problem before.

### Block Monitor
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/BlockMonitor]

Block monitor is a Minecraft sponge plugin i made a year or so ago which allows players in-game to determine who broke a 
block or did something with use of a simple command this implemented a database to store the data securely.

### Expedit public 
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/Expedit_Public]

Expedit public is a discord bot i made to use on my discord it made use of a library call Discord4J which made communication
with the discord api very easy. It also made use of the GitHub api and LavaPlayer a library designed to work with Discord4J
that enables easy music streaming from Youtube and other sources. I also used a open source library called configurate-hocon which
allows a easy config file to be generated and processed. 

### Vertx Markdown Service
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/VertxMarkdownService]

Vertx Markdown service is a simple service i made based on FlexMark(a markdown to HTML converter) 
or CommonMark(which does a similar job) and allows them to be accessed over the Vert.x event bus, it currently has near 
full coverage via JUnit and Vert.x unit tests, it also supports a generated proxy making accessing the service very easy.

### Vertx Snowflake Service
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/VertxSnowflakeService]

Vertx Snowflake service is another simple service that provides ID(Identification) generation over the Vert.x event bus
it also supports a external library called snowflake by relop. this service also has a near 100% coverage via JUnit and 
Vert.x unit tests, it also supports a automatic generated proxy accessible over the Vert.x event bus which makes this service
very easy to use

### JTwiter
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/JTwiter]

This was a project i made very recently to learn how to use Spring Boot, JPA, JVA, Lombok and Thymeleaf for this project i
used Foundation which allowed me to make a reactive site that looks quite nice. This project is very very similar to Twitter
in that it allows you to post small amounts of text, it also allows you to log in authenticate yourself and post/delete/edit
twits, this was a very good learning experience for me as i learned loads about JavaEE development.

## Kotlin
### Introduction
I think kotlin is one of my faviourte languages its like Java but with(arguably) better syntax and it greatly reduces 
the risk of NPE's(Null Point Errors)

### Vertx Annotation
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/VertxAnnotation]

Vertx annotation was my attempt at trying to implement a system similar to Spring Boots within Vert.x this project never
got very far of the ground as i found there was a project already implementing a very similar thing called (redpipe)[http://redpipe.net/]
and i couldn't see much point in reinventing it.

### Helpanto/Helpanto 1
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/Helpanto]
(github 1)[https://github.com/johnfg10/Helpanto-1]
Helpanto originally started out as a drop in replacement for Expedit_public but as time went on it got changed alot mostly
how it supported features which ended up being a bot that exposed some objects for kotlin scripting this allowed scripts 
to be loaded at runtime and supported some other interesting features.


## Go
### Introduction
I stumbled across Go when reading something on stack overflow and i thought it would be a good idea to expand my ideas
with a more functional style language, I didn't make anything overly productive with it but learned a lot about 
the functional approach

## Rust
### Introduction
Rust was another language i sort of stumbled into when reading a article about Firefox quantum and how there new multithreaded
css rendering system was built in rust. so i decided i would try it out a little.

### Rust port scanner
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/rust-portscanner]

This was a simple that unfortunately only seems to work on linux but it will go through and find open ports and print 
them to the console.

## PHP
### Introduction
I was first introduced to PHP when i did some work on XenForo which uses PHP both for the forum its self and the extensions
this was then the primary language taught to us in 

### PHP_Forum
(github)[https://github.com/johnfg10/PHP_Forum]

This was a project for my IT Level 3 Extended dimploma we had to create a forum in PHP with dynamic login/registration
this made extensive use of Bootstrap
